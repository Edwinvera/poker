# Poker
This is the repository from my course on how to build a simple poker game in Node.js.  The game couldn't be simplier.

```
node game.js
```

Creates 4 players (John, Paul, George, and Ringo) and then deals them as you would expect in a round of Texas Hold 'Em.

```
# output
After the deal, John is winning with a pair
After the flop, John is winning with a pair
After the turn, Paul is winning with a two pair
After the river, Paul is winning with a two pair
