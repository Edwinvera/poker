# Poker
This is the repository from my course on how to build a fully functional Texas Hold 'Em game in Node.js.  To run a simulated 
game, just run the following command:

```
node game.js
```

The game creates 4 players (John, Paul, George, and Ringo) and then deals them as you would expect in a round of Texas Hold 'Em.
Feel free to fork this repository and extend in any way you see fit.  If you make any improvements I want to hear about them, so 
contact me via twitter [@robbymillsap](http://twitter.com/robbymillsap).

```
# output

```

The step-by-step tutorial on how to build this poker game can be found on my website
